bands, provides a map to a Kähler manifold. The quantum metric and Berry curvature of the occupied bands are then related to the Riemannian metric and symplectic form, respectively, on the target space of quantum states. We find that the minimal volume of a parameter space with respect to the quantum metric is $\pi |\mathcal{C}|$, where $\mathcal{C}$ is the first Chern number. We determine the conditions under which the minimal volume is achieved both for the Brillouin zone and the twist-angle space. The minimal volume of the Brillouin zone, provided the quantum metric is everywhere non-degenerate, is achieved when

Metriplectic 4-bracket dynamics is generated using two generators, the Hamiltonian and the entropy, with the entropy being a Casimir of the Hamiltonian part of the system.

Rich geometrical significance of the formalism and methods for constructing metriplectic 4-brackets are explored. Many examples

generalization of Lagrangian mechanics, by adding a term, the Rayleigh dissipation function, to Lagrange’s equations of motion. However, here we follow on the early 1980s formalisms based on adding to generalizations of the Poisson bracket (see, e.g., [2,3]) a bilinear bracket which, akin to the Poisson bracket, is defined on phase space functions. These bracket formalisms were proposed in [4–9] for describing dynamics with dissipation in finite-dimensional systems, fluid mechanics, plasma models, and kinetic theories. In this paper

Morrison [Mor84 , 4]. It is in the latter paper [Mor86 ], that Morrison unifies them into the metriplectic geometric framework that has since been used extensively in plasma physics and fluid dynamics [ 5, BBPT07 ]. The GENERIC formulation itself was introduced a decade later by Grmela and Öttinger [ 7, ÖG97 ] as a generalization of the metriplectic framework, and it has been since then widely used in non-equilibrium thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. A comprehensive review of the GENERIC framework can be found in [ 9].

Neglecting Image $O(\tau ^2)$ , wave-like solutions of this equation have a speed limit Image $c=\sqrt {D/\tau }$ . By comparison theory, for hyperbolic diffusion with nonlinear bounded diffusivity function, the parameter D within this expression for the speed limit may be generalised to the least upper bound Image $D_{\max }$ . The delay Image $\tau $ may be much longer at very low temperatures. Tisza [Reference Tisza 41] and Landau [Reference Landau 30] gave alternative versions of “second sound” wave theory for the transport of heat in

Donaghy-Spargo 16]). Unlike parabolic diffusion equations, hyperbolic diffusion equations predict a bounded speed of propagation of a local disturbance. For familiar irreversible transport phenomena of heat, with matter and charge obeying the second law of thermodynamics at the meso-scale, the unbounded propagation speed of a diffusion equation causes no practical problem. For example, the one-dimensional instantaneous point source solution of the linear diffusion equation is proportional to the Gaussian, Image $t^{-1/2}\exp (-x^2/4Dt)$ . This diminishes so rapidly that at some finite distance from the source, the disturbance is so small that it is not physically measurable.

In this paper we study a Fisher-Kolmogorov type equation with a flux limited diffusion term and we prove the existence and uniqueness of finite speed moving fronts and the existence of some explicit solutions in a particular regime of the equation.

and at very large time scales and astronomical distances, the bounded speed of propagation can be significant. In molecular materials, there is a short “collision time” delay Image $\tau $ before temperature gradients can lead to fluxes via intermolecular collisions. For neon gas at standard temperature and pressure, the standard formulae from kinetic theory for mean free path and mean kinetic energy [Reference Feynman, Leighton and Sands 18] give Image $\tau \approx 7\times 10^{-10}$ s and for monovalent metals, Image $\tau \approx 10^{-14}$ s [Reference Maurer 33].

Image $\theta _t +\tau \theta _{tt}+O(\tau ^2)=D\theta _{xx}.$ In this equation, the spatial derivatives still occur within a self- adjoint operator, so that with homogeneous linear boundary conditions and smooth initial conditions, a series solution for Image $\theta (x,t)$ can be obtained as a trigonometric series after separation of variables.

Kovalevskaya Exponents, Weak Painlevé Property and Integrability for Quasi-homogeneous Differential Systems | Regular and Chaotic Dynamics
We present some necessary conditions for quasi-homogeneous differential systems to be completely integrable via Kovalevskaya exponents. Then, as an application, we give a new link between the weak-Painlevé property and the algebraical integrability for polynomial differential systems. Additionally, we also formulate stronger theorems in terms of Kovalevskaya exponents for homogeneous Newton systems, a special class of quasi-homogeneous systems, which gives its necessary conditions for B-integrability and complete integrability. A consequence is that the nonrational Kovalevskaya exponents imply the nonexistence of Darboux first integrals for two-dimensional natural homogeneous polynomial Hamiltonian systems, which relates the singularity structure to the
