The quantum metric and Berry curvature of the occupied bands are then related to the Riemannian metric and symplectic form, respectively, on the target space of quantum states. We find that the minimal volume of a parameter space with respect to the quantum metric is $\pi |\mathcal{C}|$, where $\mathcal{C}$ is the first Chern number. We determine the conditions under which the minimal volume is achieved both for the Brillouin zone and the twist-angle space. The minimal volume of the Brillouin zone, provided the quantum metric is everywhere non-degenerate, is achieved when

It is in the latter paper [Mor86 ], that Morrison unifies them into the metriplectic geometric framework that has since been used extensively in plasma physics and fluid dynamics [ 5, BBPT07 ]. The GENERIC formulation itself was introduced a decade later by Grmela and Öttinger [ 7, ÖG97 ] as a generalization of the metriplectic framework, and it has been since then widely used in non-equilibrium thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. A comprehensive review of the GENERIC framework can be found in [ 9].

For familiar irreversible transport phenomena of heat, with matter and charge obeying the second law of thermodynamics at the meso-scale, the unbounded propagation speed of a diffusion equation causes no practical problem. For example, the one-dimensional instantaneous point source solution of the linear diffusion equation is proportional to the Gaussian, Image $t^{-1/2}\exp (-x^2/4Dt)$ . This diminishes so rapidly that at some finite distance from the source, the disturbance is so small that it is not physically measurable.

In molecular materials, there is a short “collision time” delay Image $\tau $ before temperature gradients can lead to fluxes via intermolecular collisions. For neon gas at standard temperature and pressure, the standard formulae from kinetic theory for mean free path and mean kinetic energy [Reference Feynman, Leighton and Sands 18] give Image $\tau \approx 7\times 10^{-10}$ s and for monovalent metals, Image $\tau \approx 10^{-14}$ s [Reference Maurer 33].

Image $\theta _t +\tau \theta _{tt}+O(\tau ^2)=D\theta _{xx}.$ In this equation, the spatial derivatives still occur within a self- adjoint operator, so that with homogeneous linear boundary conditions and smooth initial conditions, a series solution for Image $\theta (x,t)$ can be obtained as a trigonometric series after separation of variables.

935. Kovalevskaya Exponents, Weak Painlevé Property and Integrability for Quasi-homogeneous Differential Systems | Regular and Chaotic Dynamics

936. We present some necessary conditions for quasi-homogeneous differential systems to be completely integrable via Kovalevskaya exponents. Then, as an application, we give a new link between the weak-Painlevé property and the algebraical integrability for polynomial differential systems. Additionally, we also formulate stronger theorems in terms of Kovalevskaya exponents for homogeneous Newton systems, a special class of quasi-homogeneous systems, which gives its necessary conditions for B-integrability and complete integrability. A consequence is that the nonrational Kovalevskaya exponents imply the nonexistence of Darboux first integrals for two-dimensional natural homogeneous polynomial Hamiltonian systems, which relates the singularity structure to the
