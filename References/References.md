The quantum metric and Berry curvature of the occupied bands are then related to the Riemannian metric and symplectic form, respectively, on the target space of quantum states. We find that the minimal volume of a parameter space with respect to the quantum metric is $\pi. \mathcal{C}|$, where $\mathcal{C}$ is the first Chern number. We determine the conditions under which the minimal volume is achieved both for the Brillouin zone and the twist-angle space. The minimal volume of the Brillouin zone, provided the quantum metric is everywhere non-degenerate, is achieved when. Accessed December 2, 2025.

For familiar irreversible transport phenomena of heat, with matter and charge obeying the second law of thermodynamics at the meso-scale, the unbounded propagation speed of a diffusion equation causes no practical problem. For example, the one-dimensional instantaneous point source solution of the linear diffusion equation is proportional to the Gaussian, Image $t^{-1/2}\exp (-x^2/4Dt)$ . This diminishes so rapidly that at some finite distance from the source, the disturbance is so small that it is not physically measurable. Accessed December 2, 2025.
